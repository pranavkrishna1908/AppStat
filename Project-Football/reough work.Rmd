## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data_input}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(car)
library(MASS)
library(matlib)
Goals_18 = read_csv("season-1819.csv")
Goals_19 <- read_csv("2019-20.csv")
Goals_20 = read_csv("2020-2021.csv")
Goals_21 = read_csv("2021-2022.csv")
##
goals18 = Goals_18[,2:6]
goals18$covid = 'Before'
goals19 = Goals_19[,c(2,4:7)]
goals19$covid = 'Before'
goals20 = Goals_20[,c(2,4:7)]
goals20$covid = 'In'
goals21 = Goals_21[,c(2,4:7)]
goals21$covid = 'Later'
```

## Including Plots

For 2018 only -
```{r making1model, echo=FALSE}
helper = goals18
#helper = helper[,2:6]
helper2 = pivot_longer(helper, cols = c('FTHG', 'FTAG'))
helper2$name = as.factor(ifelse(helper2$name == 'FTHG', 1,0))
helper2$Scorer = as.factor(helper2$Scorer)
helper2$Defender = as.factor(helper2$Defender)
helper2$covid = as.factor(helper2$covid)
glm(value ~ Scorer + Defender + name -1, data = helper2, family = 'poisson')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r datacomestogether}
full_data = rbind(goals18, goals19, goals20)
helper2 = full_data
#helper = helper[,2:6]
helper2 = pivot_longer(helper2, cols = c('FTHG', 'FTAG'), names_to = 'Home', values_to = 'Goals')
helper2$Home = as.factor(ifelse(helper2$Home == 'FTHG', 1,0))
helper2$Scorer = as.factor(helper2$Scorer)
helper2$Defender = as.factor(helper2$Defender)
helper2$covid = as.factor(helper2$covid)
helper2[seq(from = 2, to = nrow(helper2), by = 2),c(2,3)] = helper2[seq(from = 2, to = nrow(helper2), by = 2),c(3,2)]

```

```{r models}
no_effect = glm(Goals ~ Scorer + Defender + Home + covid -1, data = helper2, family = 'poisson')
effect = glm(Goals ~ Scorer + Defender + Home + covid + Home:covid -1, data = helper2, family = 'poisson')
anova(no_effect, effect, test = 'LRT')
```
#I cannot find the coefficient for Before covid for sme erason, im Not in the contrast paraterisation but still cannot find it

Looking at the model
```{r}
sum(fitted(effect)<5)# very bad, 2040 out of 2040, actual is 1996 aout or 2040
plot(effect)
```
##Bad residuals, over dispersion
try nb
```{r}
no_effect_star = glm.nb(Goals ~ Scorer + Defender + Home + covid -1, data = helper2 )
effect_star = glm.nb(Goals ~ Scorer + Defender + Home + covid + Home:covid -1, data = helper2)
anova(no_effect_star, effect_star, test = 'LRT')
```


nah, didnt improve anyything too much, now, before and after covid both

```{r}
full_data = rbind(goals18, goals19, goals20, goals21)
helper3 = full_data
initial_names = colnames(full_data)
initial_names[2:3] = c('Scorer', 'Defender')
colnames(helper3) = initial_names
#helper = helper[,2:6]
helper3 = pivot_longer(helper3, cols = c('FTHG', 'FTAG'), names_to = 'Home', values_to = 'Goals')
helper3$Home = as.factor(ifelse(helper3$Home == 'FTHG', 1,0))
helper3$Scorer = as.factor(helper3$Scorer)
helper3$Defender = as.factor(helper3$Defender)
helper3[seq(from = 2, to = nrow(helper3), by = 2),c(2,3)] = helper3[seq(from = 2, to = nrow(helper3), by = 2),c(3,2)]
helper3$covid = as.factor(helper3$covid)
noeffect_allseasons = glm(Goals ~ Scorer + Defender + Home + covid -1, data = helper3, family = 'poisson')
effect_allseasons = glm(Goals ~ Scorer + Defender + Home + covid + Home:covid -1, data = helper3, family = 'poisson')
Anova(effect_allseasons, type =2, test = 'LR')
anova(noeffect_allseasons, effect_allseasons, type = 'LR')
plot(predict(effect_allseasons), residuals(effect_allseasons, 'deviance'))
plot(predict(effect_allseasons), residuals(effect_allseasons, 'pearson'))
```

##Residual analysis wrt 2019-20
```{r}
first_index = nrow(goals18)
last_index = nrow(goals19) + first_index
relevant_residuals = residuals(effect_allseasons, 'deviance')[first_index:last_index]
plot(relevant_residuals)
qqnorm(relevant_residuals)
```

##This residuals vs cvariates
```{r}
plot_data = helper3[,-c(1)]

plot_data %>%
mutate(res=resid(effect_allseasons), Scorer = as.numeric(Scorer), Defender = as.numeric(Defender), covid = as.numeric(covid), Home = as.numeric(Home))%>% 
pivot_longer(-res)%>% ggplot(aes(y=res,x=value)) +
facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free") + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
library(car)
Anova(effect_allseasons, test = 'LR', type = 2)
#We see that the onteraction is significant
#Home is significant as expected
```
NOw, bootstrap
#get the coefficients ?
```{r}
CI_table = confint(effect_allseasons)
CItable = as.data.frame(CI_table)
CI_table[,3] = 0.5*(CI_table[,2] - CI_table[,1])
N = 1000
temp_params = mvrnorm(n = N, mu = CI_table$Mean, Sigma = inv(vcov(effect_allseasons)))#temptemp$cov.scaled for temptemp = summary(effectallseasons)
temp_params = mvrnorm(n = N, mu = CI_table$Mean, Sigma = diag(CI_table[,3]**2))

Boot_threshold = effect_allseasons$deviance/2744  #it is res deg of freedom
Boot_stat = rep(0, N)
temp_data = helper3
X_matrix = model.matrix(effect_allseasons)
for(i in 1:N){
  temp_data$Goals = rpois(nrow(temp_data), exp(X_matrix %*% temp_params[i,]))
  effect_allseasons_boot = glm(Goals ~ Scorer + Defender + Home + covid + Home:covid -1, data = temp_data, family = 'poisson')
 Boot_stat[i] = effect_allseasons_boot$deviance/2744 #it is res deg of freedom
  }
sum(Boot_stat>Boot_threshold)/N
```


#Get data
```{r}
N = 100
Boot_stat = rep(0, N)

sim_data = simulate(effect_allseasons, nsim = N)
for(i in 1:N){
  temp_data$Goals = sim_data[,i]
