## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
Goals_18 = read_csv("Project-Football/season-1819.csv")
Goals_19 <- read_csv("Project-Football/2019-20.csv")
Goals_20 = read_csv("Project-Football/2020-2021.csv")
Goals_21 = read_csv("Project-Football/2021-2022.csv")
##
goals18 = Goals_18[,1:6]
goals19 = Goals_19[,2:7]
goals20 = Goals_20[,2:7]
goals21 = Goals_21[,2:7]

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
