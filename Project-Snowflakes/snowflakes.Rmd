```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The data we have is from a PhD student at an EPFL lab regarding snow-flake diameters. The data is binned with non-uniform bin-length. We remove the bins with zero entries and look at the data. We see a bi-modal distribution on making a histogram of the data.

We know that the data is supposed to be a mixture of two log-normal distributions which is not contrary to the expert knowledge as the data is bi modal.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
