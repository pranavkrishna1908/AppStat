## R Markdown

In this project, we look atht espread of COVID-19 in the United States in the first wave. We have state-wise data regarding the number of deaths for each state

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
